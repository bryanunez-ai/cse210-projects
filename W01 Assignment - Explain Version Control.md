# What is version control and why is it important?
Version Control is a system that allows to keep track of changes in a project, like Git.

One of the many benefits of version control systems such as Git, is that it helps teams to collaborate in projects simultaneously. For example, Git allows to work in branches, so that the main code doesn't crash if a mistake is made in the latest commit. This ensures that the main code always works.

Git is simple to work with. You can use the terminal to push your changes using commands like:

```bash
git commit -m "Your super descriptive comment here"
```

This is how version control systems work. They are very important in software development because they help to ensure main code is always working and available and allows teams to work in parallel.
